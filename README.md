# Signatures Gallery — open mint

The default app separates **playful previews** from **wallet → independent Grok assessment → mint & reveal**. Anyone may mint any available handle. There is no X login, ownership claim, or claim withdrawal in this flow.

The latest [next-agent handoff](MEMO.md) records the unfinished slogan refinement and current development state. The older root `HANDOFF.md` contains historical, superseded workflows; use this README and [open-mint architecture](docs/open-mint.md) for the active app.

- `/p/<handle>/<MBTI>` renders one freely editable preview, such as `/p/Alice_Bob_Key/ENFP`. Consumer Grok can choose the preview MBTI in the user's chat; previews make zero paid X or Grok calls and do not create an authoritative assessment.
- `/p/<handle>/variations` keeps the 16-type comparison grid. Once a mint is confirmed, both preview routes redirect case variants to the saved artwork spelling; the selected type displays its archived artifact, and the other 15 stay clickable alternatives using the recorded renderer. The CTA becomes **View minted signature**. Pending and unavailable states never expose a prepared choice or suggest the handle is available to mint.
- `/<MBTI>/` groups gallery works by their existing personality, such as `/ISTJ/`. MBTI tags on works link here. These read-only pages show matching confirmed mints (or chainless gallery samples in explicit fixture mode), never regenerate a work or change its MBTI. Preview images remain editable only in the separate preview flow.
- Artwork captions share one layout across details, previews, variations, galleries, and collections: `@handle × MBTI` on the left and the applicable status on the right edge beneath the image. Only confirmed/explicit sample mints carry `Minted`; alternative variations remain previews. Unconfirmed mint screens do not expose the prepared MBTI, and the locked artwork bytes are unchanged by caption styling.
- `/mint` accepts **only a handle**, optionally prefilled by a preview. A fresh signed wallet proof and explicit **Mint & reveal** action are required before the backend verifies the username with X and starts its independent xAI/X Search run. Neither visiting nor connecting a wallet starts research.
- The first successful assessment is saved and reused. New previews and assessments use the native handle + MBTI [Signature renderer v2.0.0](reference/algorithm-v2.0.0/README.md), pinned to the prototype release. Existing v1 assessments and minted artwork retain their original renderer, bytes and commitments.
- The homepage slogan separately adopts [v2.0.1's long-text layout policy](reference/algorithm-v2.0.1/README.md). Its eight captured shapes use an expanded horizontal canvas, not compressed handle spacing. This brand-only update does not change signature input limits, renderer versions or saved artwork.
- The new contract allows **one token per lowercase literal handle**, regardless of MBTI or renderer. This does not confer ownership of the X account. `OldName` and `NewName` are distinct identities even if one account used both; case-only edits are the same identity. Account reassignment does not release a previously minted name.
- Preview spelling stays editable. New real mint preparation uses the exact `username` returned by X's authenticated lookup, never a client-selected spelling; its lowercase form must match the submitted canonical handle. The X account ID binds research evidence to that subject, but never changes the token's handle-based uniqueness.
- Verification freshness is **at the first successful preparation only**. The saved timestamp, X username/account ID, assessment, renderer and artifact are frozen together. Later retries and reopened mint windows reuse that snapshot without lookup, re-assessment or rerendering. This is not a claim that the username or account is still current at confirmation; renames and reassignment do not free or transfer a minted handle key.
- Historical unverified assessments and artifacts remain readable and retain their exact bytes/digests. Real mode blocks new preparation and authorization for those records (`X_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED`); it never silently upgrades or replaces them. Previously signed on-chain vouchers cannot be revoked by this server policy. Explicit development fixtures remain internally separate and do not claim X verification.
- Private `/mint/<code>` requests last 15 minutes and are paired to the requesting browser session and wallet. The voucher binds the recipient, artwork, chain, contract, nonce and deadline. Price is zero; the wallet pays gas. Final artwork is revealed in the UI only after confirmed minting; home and `/me` show minted tokens only.
- The final result can differ from the consumer-chat preview. This is a UI reveal, not cryptographic secrecy: the transaction binds an already prepared artifact. Cancelling or refreshing never asks Grok for a different result. Uncertain provider attempts are held for operator reconciliation, not automatically retried.

## Run the new app

```bash
# Put XAI_API_KEY and OPEN_MINT_X_BEARER_TOKEN in ignored .env.local.
# A missing X token blocks new real preparation before paid Grok work.
npm run dev           # Preview browsing; minting disabled without the chain
npm run dev -- --fixture # Preview-only UI with a simulated minted gallery; no Anvil needed
npm run dev:open      # Real X username lookup + Grok + isolated local Anvil
npm run dev:fixture   # Explicit simulated assessment + isolated local Anvil
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Use `PORT=3002` if the earlier app still owns port 3000. Foundry is required for the Anvil commands. Fixture and real-assessment data are separate under `.local/open-mint/`; old `.local/rehearsal/`, PostgreSQL, contracts, and `.env.local` are untouched. Product pages intentionally omit developer overlays and fixture notices. Use a wallet connected to the local chain, then explicitly choose **Mint & reveal** to run the isolated test mint. Test keys/funds are not for public networks; the local test-wallet endpoints remain gated to their development configuration.

`OPEN_MINT_X_BEARER_TOKEN` is a server-only X API app-only Bearer Token with username-lookup access. The transport uses the fixed official [`GET /2/users/by/username/{username}` endpoint](https://docs.x.com/x-api/users/get-user-by-username) and [app-only authentication](https://docs.x.com/x-api/users/lookup/integrate). It makes one bounded request per admitted first preparation; missing users, mismatched handles, API/auth/rate-limit failures and uncertain attempts fail closed without a paid retry or fixture fallback. Never put this token in frontend configuration. The `.env.local.example` contains only an empty placeholder. Integration tests mock both transports; they do not establish live account access or spend credits.

In fixture mode **without a chain**, home displays 80 read-only gallery samples,
five per MBTI type, rendered with v2.0.0. The original 16 samples remain unchanged;
the catalog includes all 77 valid exact-case prototype preset handles plus
`beeple`, `xcopyart`, and `refikanadol` from the earlier gallery inputs.
Cards open `/signatures/<handle>` detail pages with matching original SVGs;
old `/dev/gallery/<handle>` links redirect there in this mode.
The page URLs and copy match the production design, with no floating DEV panel
or simulation notices. These remain sample data: no token was minted, no Grok
assessment ran, and no account-owner participation or endorsement is implied.
The internal fixture state remains separate from real minted records.
Samples are not written to the store, do not appear in `/me`,
and do not occupy handles. The sample gallery and detail resolution are disabled
outside fixture mode or when a chain is configured; those galleries continue to
show only confirmed mints. Saved artwork and chain snapshots are never seeded or
rewritten by this presentation fixture.

Local artifacts are content-addressed and checked but **not publicly pinned**. Production startup remains disabled pending deployment/security review and production storage, sessions, rate limits and indexing. See [architecture and handoff](docs/open-mint.md).

Private Grok chat asks for a handle, resolves its current X username capitalization, assesses its MBTI, and returns `/p/<handle>/<MBTI>` without the leading `@`. This lookup happens in the user's chat, not on the preview server, and is a convenience rather than trusted mint evidence. Visitors may still edit unminted preview spelling and MBTI directly. **Mint for this handle** carries only the handle into `/mint?handle=…`; no preview MBTI crosses that boundary. The consumer chat is not sealed or trusted. Research content can still influence an LLM: the backend attestation records our workflow, not objective MBTI truth or prompt-injection immunity.

Validate with `npm run test:open`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:contract`, `npm run build`, and `npm run renderer:verify`.

## Historical V1/V2 claims reference

**Everything below describes the preserved legacy application**, accessible only through `npm run legacy:dev` or the existing `local:serve:*` commands. Its routes and auth requirements are not part of the new default app.

### signatures.gallery V2 (legacy)

Signatures Gallery is the inaugural project presented by [Agent Art (@AgentArt_AA)](https://x.com/AgentArt_AA). It operates within [Agent Art](https://inshell.art/docs/agent-art)—the open field of art activity in which an Agent participates. An artist-defined system turns the characters of an X handle into a handwriting-like signature. In the intended private workflow, Grok reads recent public posts and selects `gr0k`, the environmental condition in which that signature is rendered—not a score, mood, probability, or judgment.

The formal renderer follows [Signature Algorithm v1.0.0](https://github.com/inshell-art/agent-art-Signature-prototype/tree/v1.0.0), frozen at commit `1e1dab4ec093261006feb7879c109413c0b3ac6d`. It accepts an exact-case X handle and an integer `gr0k` seed from **1 through 100** (default 22), renders a side-effect-free preview, authenticates the matching account through X OAuth, and saves the exact artwork after explicit claim consent. Account matching remains case-insensitive; artwork input and signature identity preserve case. V2 adds an opt-in Ethereum mint path without changing the artwork.

See [formal algorithm adoption](docs/formal-algorithm-v1.md) for the pinned source, parity checks, output contract, and deliberate retirement of old decimal-seed artwork and permalinks.

**Renderer visually approved and locked: 2026-09-10.** The [lock manifest](reference/algorithm-v1.0.0/renderer-lock.json) pins the validated implementation and complete SVG goldens. `npm run renderer:verify` checks it; normal dev, test and build commands fail on drift. Future artwork changes require a new version and explicit approval, never replacement under an existing signature ID.

The current local build implements the complete V1 product flow plus two clearly labelled V2 rehearsals: the dependency-free in-memory UI fixture and a real repo-local PostgreSQL 16 + Anvil 31337 workflow:

- `GET|HEAD /s/{handle}/{gr0k}` — side-effect-free preview with canonical redirects.
- `GET /renders/{renderer_version}/{handle}/{gr0k}.{svg|png}` — versioned preview assets.
- `POST /auth/x/start` and `GET /auth/x/callback` — session-bound OAuth/PKCE flow.
- “Claim with X” saves the exact signature when the matching OAuth identity returns, then redirects directly to `/signatures/{id}`. A one-time, session-bound success toast appears for five seconds of active viewing, pausing on hover, keyboard focus, or an inactive tab/window; shared links and refreshes do not replay it.
- `GET /s/{handle}/{gr0k}?flow=…#claim` — private retry or legacy confirmation state. Successful flows redirect to the permanent signature page. `POST /api/v1/signatures` handles explicit retries and legacy confirmations. The old `/claim/review` route redirects here.
- `GET /me` — private account collection.
- `POST /signatures/{signature_id}/withdraw` — claimant-only deletion with a one-use X approval for the exact withdrawal, active session, same-origin check, CSRF, explicit confirmation, and a per-claim instance token. No withdrawn state or restore view. It removes the claim from Claimed and My Collection; the permalink/artifact endpoints return 404. Claiming the same input later inserts a fresh row/date/instance, although the deterministic artwork ID and URL remain the same. Old forms cannot delete the new claim.
- `GET|HEAD /about` — About the work: the handle, Agent contribution, claiming, minting, and provenance boundaries.
- `GET|HEAD /dev/collection-states?state=empty` — development-only, read-only My Collection state fixtures; never modifies sessions, claims, wallets, or the chain.
- `GET|HEAD /dev/button-study` — the selected compact Hairline button, soft-filled status tags, three alternative button treatments, and a selectable claim-page specimen. Preview only; no authentication, claims, or saved theme/style preferences.
- `GET /signatures/{signature_id}` and `/artifacts/{signature_id}.{svg|png}` — stable claimed record and immutable assets.
- `POST /api/v2/wallet-bindings/challenge` and `/confirm` — exact session-, signature-, and claim-instance-bound SIWE recipient proof inside minting.
- `DELETE /api/v2/wallet-bindings/current` — retained guarded internal binding revocation; no global wallet-management UI.
- `GET /signatures/{signature_id}/mint` — active-claimant-session check and fresh wallet proof, then exact-work/recipient review, chain facts, fees, provenance limits, and irreversible-publication consent.
- `POST /api/v2/signatures/{signature_id}/mint-authorizations` — exact EIP-712 authorization; the interactive local entrypoint durably checkpoints intent before signing and the signed authorization before return. Normalized production persistence remains a gate.
- `POST /api/v2/mint-authorizations/{authorization_id}/transactions` — advisory transaction report only.
- `GET /api/v2/signatures/{signature_id}/mint-status` — projection state without a per-request RPC call.
- Home has **Claimed | Minted** galleries. Claimed (the default) lists all successful, explicitly authorized claim commits, including works later minted, independent of the visitor's login. A preview or ordinary account sign-in never creates a claim. The combined **Sign in with X and claim this signature** CTA authorizes saving on the matching OAuth return. Minted lists only finalized mint projections. Both exclude suppressed records. Claimed remains `noindex`; production Minted and finalized permalinks are indexable.
- Legacy three-segment `/s`, `/c`, and `/v` routes return `410 Gone`.

The V2 foundation also includes the strict V1 digest/token-ID bridge, deterministic RFC 8785 NFT metadata and frozen UnixFS CID profile, canonical low-`s` signature validation, dual-RPC EOA checking, additive PostgreSQL migration, a frozen-ABI log decoder with restartable reorg/finality and control-state projections, content-writer fencing, and a non-upgradeable OpenZeppelin ERC-721 contract.

See [V2 implementation status](docs/v2-implementation-status.md) for the exact boundary between executable local behavior, reference-model safeguards, guarded deployment tooling, and work that still depends on real infrastructure or approval. Nothing in the current repository is a production-readiness or deployment claim.

## Local inspection

### Claim withdrawal

On your own signature detail page, expand **Withdraw claim** using its arrow and choose **Withdraw claim**. When X confirmation is needed, a transient “Opening X to confirm your identity…” notice appears during the OAuth handoff. The callback confirms only this exact claim and instance; returning from X does not delete it. Back on the signature page, use the revealed withdrawal CTA and choose **Confirm withdrawal** in the dialog. The dialog identifies the exact handle/gr0k; **Cancel** or Escape leaves the claim untouched. Without JavaScript, an inline disclosure still requires an explicit **Confirm withdrawal**. A minted work cannot be withdrawn. Prepared, signed, submitted, uncertain, and unreconciled mint authority blocks deletion even if the visible projection says “Not minted”; only chain-reconciled unused expiry releases that guard in the local runtime. Withdrawal and authorization share the claim lock and local durable operation queue. The database deletion and local mint-snapshot cleanup commit together. Wallet links and other claims are retained. Shared artifact bytes are not destructively deleted; only this claim's references are detached. Previously downloaded copies cannot be recalled.

Migration `003_claim_withdrawal.sql` is additive and applied by the local server and rehearsal setup without resetting data. It adds a random claim-instance ID, preserves the original administrative erasure guard, and permits narrowly checked ordinary withdrawal. Normalized V2 publication/mint records remain conservatively blocked; this does not enable the still-gated production mint repository. Claim routes use `no-store` because deleted records must not be served from a long-lived page/artifact cache.

Never-authorized claims can be withdrawn while local Anvil is unavailable: the check and deletion still run inside the same exclusive, durable database queue as minting. Any mint-authorization history—including expired authority—requires fresh successful chain reconciliation before withdrawal. Mint issuance keeps its existing chain-readiness requirement.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000. Development fixtures are enabled by default. Claimed contains 90 stored rehearsal claims; Minted contains 88 explicitly simulated finalized works, paginated in groups of 24. Both tabs use the same [fixture library](src/v2/galleryFixtures.ts): the original eleven public X handles from digital art and technology merged with the handle presets from the pinned prototype v1.0.0. Its 80-entry constant contains three overlong handles, excluded by the same 1–15-character validation used by the upstream UI. The 77 valid presets, deduplicating `tylerxhobbs`, produce 87 unique catalog handles, plus Alice's three interactive rehearsal claims. The original eleven retain their varied `gr0k` values; the 76 additions use the formal default of 22 to compare handle shapes, preserving uppercase letters, digits, and underscores exactly. The preset strings are renderer examples, not a fresh verification of live X accounts. All seeded identities, `gr0k` values, claims, wallets, mints and transfers are fictional, with no participation or endorsement implied; this warning stays in the separate DEV overlay. Each library entry records its handle's source. Some show a simulated transfer so claimant, initial recipient, and current holder are visibly distinct. These samples use stored renderer output and working detail pages, not placeholder images. They are seeded only by this in-memory entrypoint; the durable PostgreSQL + Anvil rehearsal retains its separate chain-backed seed. Both tabs use centered, same-color labels with a background box on the selected tab, server-rendered links and stable keyset pagination; switching tabs starts at that gallery's first page and works without JavaScript.

Claimed and Minted link to the same `/signatures/{id}` detail page and stored artwork. Details share home's 1024px canvas, 14px regular typography and system theme: one centered artwork, compact 3px-padded status tags, an 11px four-square Gallery icon balanced against the 10px My Collection dot, both centered in 44px targets. Every committed signature shows Claimed; only a finalized mint adds Minted. Pending or incident states remain explicit. The single native Provenance disclosure contains historical claim evidence, complete artwork hashes and mint/holder records; it works without JavaScript. Canonical SVG display and PNG `og:image` previews are unchanged. Claim consent is disclosed beside the combined sign-in-and-claim CTA; matching OAuth saves it without a second confirmation. Wallet proof and mint authorization remain separate explicit actions on the one mint page.

All HTML interface text uses Instrument Sans at 14px / 400, including mint review, account controls, tooltips, forms, footers, and development studies. `--ui-font-size` is the single size token. The 16px root remains a layout unit for existing rem-based spacing; SVG artwork geometry and authored SVG text are excluded from the UI type rule.

The local identity flow is a real authorization-code/PKCE rehearsal backed by an in-process provider emulator, not an X login:

1. Open **My Collection** → **Sign in with X**. In this environment the normal action routes to the local simulator, not X.
2. In the automatically opened amber **DEV** panel, choose **@alice** and **Approve local identity**. The browser returns through `/auth/x/callback`, validates one-time state and PKCE, and rotates the session before showing Alice's three seeded claims. The account chooser and failure controls are development tools, not a proposed gallery sign-in page.
3. Open `/s/alice/37` → **Claim with X**. Authentication saves the public claim and returns directly to its detail page. A failed save offers **Retry claim**. Ordinary account sign-in creates no claim.
4. From Alice's collection, use **Mint this signature** to inspect minting. Use **Advance rehearsal** inside DEV to advance an existing simulated authorization. No wallet signature, IPFS publication, Ethereum transaction, or finality observation is real in this in-memory mode.

To inspect failure handling, start again and choose **Simulate account denial** or **Simulate provider error**. To exercise account selection, choose **@newcomer** (no seeded claims), or choose Bob while claiming an Alice preview to see the handle-mismatch stop. Bob may already have claims from earlier rehearsals. Log out and restart the flow to switch accounts. Authorization requests, codes, and callback state are one-time and expire.

Empty Claimed and Minted galleries, an empty private `/me`, and signed-out `/me` share one participation component: **To participate, ask Grok for your signature**, **Step 1: Copy the prompt**, and **Step 2: Paste into Grok ↗**. The prompt is provisional copy centralized in `src/v1/grokPrompt.ts`, ready to replace later. It currently preserves the V1 private-Grok contract, carries the remaining preview/sign-in/explicit-claim instructions, and uses the configured site origin. Anonymous prompts ask for a handle before producing a link; public galleries never personalize this from a private session. Signed-in empty collections use the authenticated handle. Existing collection access stays below the participation steps on signed-out `/me`. A closed **View prompt** disclosure allows manual copying without JavaScript and opens with selected text if clipboard access fails. Both step labels retain the same compact CTA highlight; the external arrow is outside the highlight. No prompt is sent automatically to Grok. Signed-in emulator accounts retain a short, explicitly qualified local-sample link. Populated galleries/collections, errors, and claim/mint authorization screens are not replaced by onboarding.

For repeatable UI inspection, open the amber **DEV** overlay and use **Switch fixture**, or set `/dev/collection-states?state=KEY` directly. All 19 fixture links come from the same catalog used to render the fixture pages; the current state is highlighted. Available keys are `signed-out`, `empty`, `gallery-claimed-empty`, `gallery-minted-empty`, `claimed`, `wallet-linked`, `recipient-verified`, `wrong-claimant`, `authorized`, `submitted`, `confirming`, `minted`, `transferred`, `validation-pending`, `quarantined`, `finality-revoked`, `mint-paused`, `reauthenticate`, and `renamed`. For example, [inspect a transferred token](http://127.0.0.1:3000/dev/collection-states?state=transferred). There is no state selector or development-link section inside the page layout. The amber **DEV · UI fixture** disclosure floats above the page and contains the switcher, current override, and notes. **DEV · Local rehearsal** identifies interactive development pages and also offers the switcher when fixture routes are enabled. This developer overlay is separate from the gallery, reserves no layout space, and is absent on production pages. Fixture pages use the same page and account-panel renderers and spacing as normal pages, but force simulated data; their status does not reflect or update your live collection. Account/mint mutation controls are disabled and no live wallet/indexer scripts run. Copying the provisional prompt and viewing it remain available. Use the normal My Collection dot or open `/me` to leave the read-only preview and rehearse the interactive flow.

The DEV panel collapses on an outside click/tap or Escape. Internal fixture links remain usable, and outside page links still navigate normally. Escape returns focus to the DEV trigger only when focus was inside the panel; the native disclosure toggle remains usable without JavaScript.

Rehearsal explanations and controls belong in the floating DEV overlay, not in product provenance or authentication copy. Local samples, simulated recipient proofs, lifecycle advancement, and Anvil TEST-wallet mint/transfer tools stay inside DEV. The account panel is X-only. **Connect wallet** in minting uses the injected browser wallet and never silently falls back to simulation. DEV recipient tools appear only in an exact mint context for its active original-claimant session, with current session and CSRF values; they never provide global wallet setup. The TEST-wallet mint button remains tied to the actual review form's required publication-consent checkbox. Local networks and transaction values are not relabelled as mainnet. Content-versioned CSS and JavaScript URLs prevent stale presentation or handlers after reload.

**Next-step visibility:** the signed-in original claimant sees **Mint this signature** without global wallet setup; public signed-out/non-owner detail views do not expose mint or withdrawal controls. `/signatures/{id}/mint` is one page: it shows the exact work, **Recipient**, **Network**, **Cost** (no project fee; the wallet estimates gas), the permanence notice and consent. The recipient row carries **Connect wallet** until a fresh proof exists, and the authorization form appears only once it does, so connecting a wallet is a state of the mint page rather than a screen before it. Hashes, renderer and metadata URI stay one click away under **Verification details**. A separate gate page covers only what the mint page cannot resolve: sign-in, wrong claimant, and pending/paused states. Under an active claimant session, **Connect wallet** goes directly to the wallet: its explicit CSRF-protected proof request binds the exact signature, claim instance, chain, and previous binding. An existing address is only a convenience, never proof for a new mint. **Change recipient** empties the recipient row and requires a new proof, not another X trip; live/unresolved authority blocks changes and retry resumes that issued capability. Cancel navigates away without deleting authority. Read-only fixtures use `?state=KEY&view=mint`; `wallet-linked` means **Previous recipient**, and legacy `reauthenticate` demonstrates **Active session · connect wallet**.

**Authentication lifetimes:** the app session retains seven-day idle expiry. Minting trusts this active session's stable numeric X identity, without routine reauthentication; stolen valid sessions are consequently a mint-authority risk, which fresh proof of an attacker's own wallet cannot eliminate. Withdrawal retains one-use, target-bound X confirmation. Existing deadlines are unchanged: OAuth flow 15 minutes, SIWE challenge 10 minutes, exact-mint review draft 15 minutes, signed mint authority 900 seconds of chain time. Same-origin/CSRF checks, fresh wallet proof, and exact work/recipient review still apply. Scopes stay `users.read tweet.read`, without `offline.access`. See [the authentication policy](docs/authentication-policy.md).

For the default `npm run dev` entrypoint, real X OAuth takes precedence when both `X_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `X_OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` are configured. The durable launcher makes the provider explicit: `local:serve:x` uses real X, while `local:serve:emulator` always uses the simulator. See [Real X + local app](docs/real-x-local.md).

Signed-out mint entry uses ordinary **Sign in with X**, then continues directly to wallet connection under that session. Existing issued/pending authority also uses ordinary sign-in for safe resumption; wrong-account recovery switches identity first. A block caused by another signature's pending mint is described explicitly as another mint, not the current work's status.

Run `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npm run test:contract`, `npm run test:manifest`, and `npm run test:manifest:roles` before committing. The status document includes the scoped V2 checks.

The homepage slogan uses a checked-in shape snapshot; separate words or an underscore-joined phrase can be captured through the composition adapter. Run `npm run slogan:inspect` to compare that lock with the current renderer, or add `-- --json` to emit the complete review candidate. See [the composition boundary](docs/slogan-composition.md) before accepting a renderer or slogan change.

The site uses one type family: **Instrument Sans**, self-hosted from the pinned `@fontsource-variable/instrument-sans` dependency. Regular (400), medium (500), and semibold (600) provide the hierarchy; numeric records use tabular figures. The shared CSS includes upright and true italic Latin/extended-Latin subsets; only upright Latin is preloaded. Font assets and the SIL OFL license are served from versioned `/assets/fonts/instrument-sans-<package-version>/` URLs, with no Google Fonts/CDN request. Keep runtime dependencies in compiled deployments (`npm ci --omit=dev`); font resolution works from both `src` and `dist`. The slogan, question mark, and signature SVG/PNG bytes remain independent of site typography.

The collection dot is always a native, one-click link to `/me`, including while its hover panel is open. There is no separate native tooltip: **My Collection** appears as the panel heading above X sign-in/logout controls. Wallet setup is available only within minting. The heading remains visible while private content refreshes or fails to load. Keyboard focus can expose the same controls; the touch toggle remains separate from the direct collection link.

### Durable PostgreSQL + Anvil rehearsal

The interactive local path supports **claim → real SIWE proof → signed Anvil mint → automatic indexing → transfer**, with PostgreSQL durability. With PostgreSQL 16 and Foundry installed, preserve an existing rehearsal and start its foreground app:

```bash
npm run local:up
npm run local:verify
npm run local:serve
```

On first run, `local:up` initializes the local schemas/chain, deploys the contract to loopback Anvil 31337, and seeds one signed mint using public test keys. Use `npm run local:reset` only to intentionally erase and recreate this repository's ignored `.local/rehearsal` data, with the foreground app stopped.

Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000/s/alice/73> → **Claim with X** → approve **@alice** in the emulator → **Claimed**, without a second confirmation. From My Collection, choose **Mint this signature**, then **Connect wallet**. Your active X session is sufficient; no further X trip is needed. Alternatively choose **Use local TEST wallet** inside DEV and explicitly approve its real one-time wallet proof. Review the exact signature, recipient, fees, and permanent publication before authorizing and confirming the local transaction. Every new mint needs fresh wallet proof, even when reusing an address. No extension is required for the narrowly scoped public Anvil test wallet at index 6. Once indexed, **Transfer local token** sends to the fixed second TEST wallet at index 7 using Ethereum authority; claimant and initial recipient provenance remain unchanged. Never send real funds to these public-key accounts. An injected browser wallet is available for a dedicated local EOA.

The foreground app defaults to the X simulator. To use real X with the same local PostgreSQL and Anvil, fill OAuth 2.0 Web App credentials in git-ignored `.env.local`, run `npm run local:auth:check`, then `npm run local:serve:x`. Real mode validates configuration before touching infrastructure and disables simulator endpoints. Register `http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/x/callback` exactly in a separate X development app. [Setup and live walkthrough](docs/real-x-local.md). V1 claims and content-addressed artifact references are durable; wallet bindings, authorizations, mint attempts, and indexer state use PostgreSQL snapshots. A single exclusive writer serializes mint operations and atomically commits the indexer cursor with its public projections. Two-second Anvil interval mining plus roughly one-second polling discovers actual mint/transfer logs even if the browser fails to report a transaction. The label **Local Anvil automatic confirmation; single node** explicitly does not mean Ethereum finality. IPFS CIDs are deterministic but remain unpublished/unpinned; development metadata is not production provenance.

App restarts require another login with the selected X provider because browser sessions/flows remain ephemeral. Claims, real SIWE bindings, mints, transfers, and indexing progress persist. The old CLI-seeded wallet binding is revoked at startup and cannot authorize new interactive mints. Keep `http://127.0.0.1:3000` as the app origin throughout a rehearsal: unfinished frozen metadata is not regenerated when a port changes.

With the app running, an explicit local-only test creates a Bob claim, signs a proof, mints, transfers, and verifies unchanged artwork. Save its printed signature ID for a read-only restart check:

```bash
npm run local:test -- --execute-local-test-transactions
# After restarting the app, substitute the signature ID printed above:
npm run local:test -- --verify SIGNATURE_ID
```

Stop the foreground app with Ctrl-C before `npm run local:stop`. `local:up`, `local:reset`, and `local:stop` refuse to run over an active app writer. `local:up` reuses persisted state without redeploying or replaying fixtures over later account metadata, and refuses a mismatched V2 migration checksum. `npm run test:postgres:local` applies every schema/migration to a separate fresh disposable PostgreSQL cluster. Full walkthrough, failure/restart behavior, guards, ports, and limitations are in [the local rehearsal runbook](docs/local-rehearsal.md).

## Production blockers

The renderer is the formal v1.0.0 algorithm. The bundled wallet, signer, chain, IPFS, and finality fixtures remain local inspection tools, not production provenance. Production startup still fails closed for infrastructure reasons. Mainnet deployment is explicitly forbidden without a separate approval.

The project still requires:

- production-grade normalized Postgres repositories, external content-addressed object storage, distributed session/flow and rate-limit adapters, plus staging migration/restore rehearsal (the bundled PostgreSQL/file adapters are local-only);
- production X OAuth credentials and live smoke testing;
- two independent IPFS pin providers and an integrity gateway;
- two independent archive-capable RPC providers, durable finality indexer, protected KMS/HSM signer, and deployment role addresses;
- Sepolia deployment/rehearsal, contract review, deployment manifest, CDN/publication fencing, and the operator erasure runbook.

No private Grok transcript, source Post, rationale, or X token enters V2 metadata or the contract. The finalized public record intentionally links the opaque account reference, historical handle, artwork commitments, initial recipient, and Ethereum transaction. Internal wallet-proof/binding records remain retained; moving their UX into minting does not erase provenance. The existing project fee is unchanged, and no one-token-per-user limit is added: one user may claim and mint multiple distinct signatures.
